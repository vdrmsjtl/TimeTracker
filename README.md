## **Usage**

Once executed, Time Tracker, represented by a Task Tray icon, immediately starts tracking your work hours. Below are the Time Tracker's operations:

- Hover over the task tray icon to see the current status including worked hours, remaining time, status, and break time.
- Double-click on the icon to take a break or continue working.
- Right-click the icon and select "Take a Break / Continue" to start or stop a break.
- Right-click the icon and select "Discard session & Exit" to discard the current session and close the application without saving.
- Right-click the icon and select "Save & Exit" to end the session and close the application.
- On closing the app, the current session ends and worked times (including breaks) are saved.

**Tip**: **Add a shortcut to Windows Autostart to automatically run the application on Windows startup!**
